This guide will give you all the necessary information you need to become a successful code contributor!

== Setup

To build this project, you will need {uri-nodejs}[Node.js] >= 8.11 and `npm` (we recommend {uri-nvm}[nvm] to manage multiple active Node.js versions).

NOTE: If you feel more comfortable with `yarn`, you can use it as an alternative to `npm`

== Building

. Install all the dependencies
+
 $ npm install

. Build the project 
+
 $ npm run build
+
This command will produce a zip file that can be load in Chrome: [.path]_dist/asciidoctor-browser-extension.zip_

. Run tests
+
 $ npm run test

[IMPORTANT]
====
The tests suite is run against an Headless instance of Chromium.
When you installed the development dependencies, https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer[Puppeteer] had automatically installed Chromium for your platform.
So you shouldn't need to manually install Chromium or Chrome in order to run the tests suite.

It's not recommended, but if your are running the tests suite as `root`, you will see the following error in the console:

```
INFO [launcher]: Starting browser ChromeHeadless
ERROR [launcher]: Cannot start ChromeHeadless
	ERROR:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(89)] Running as root without --no-sandbox is not supported. See https://crbug.com/638180.
```

To workaround this issue you can run the following command instead:

 $ npm run test:nosandbox

It will launch a Chromium instance with the `--no-sandbox` argument.
====

This project is using a code linter to enforce code consistency. 
To make sure that the code you have contributed, follow the code rules, execute the following command:

 $ npm run lint:code

== Add-on Linter

Mozilla provides a Node.js package to validate an add-on.
You can run the linter with `npm`:

 $ npm run lint:firefox

NOTE: The linter will inspect the archive produced by `npm run build`, so make sure the file `dist/asciidoctor-browser-extension.zip` is present before running this command.

== Release

. Build and run the tests
. Make sure that everything is working fine by loading the extension as an "unpack extension"
. Edit the `changelog.adoc` file
. Update the version in `app/manifest.json`
. Commit the changes
. Tag the version
