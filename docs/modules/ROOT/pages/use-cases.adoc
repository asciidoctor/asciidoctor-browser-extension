[#uc-add-toc]
== Add a TOC

Add a TOC to a document written without one, so that it's easier to navigate and use.

****
Sometimes documents are written without TOCs for good reason - they may be part of a larger system, or automatically generated.
What ever the reason, you can add one using the {project-name}.
****

*Problem: A document is not written with a TOC*

It's long. It's hard to navigate.

*Solution: Use {project-name} to add a TOC*

Add the `toc` setting depending on your need below:

* For all documents viewed, use a xref:custom-attributes-option.adoc[common attribute]:

 toc=left

* For the current document, use a xref:features.adoc#url-query-parameters[query parameters]:

 ?toc=left

* If editing the document, use this AsciiDoc in the header:

 :toc: left

[NOTE]
====
To remove a TOC that's already there use `toc` followed by an exclamation mark (`!`).

* Custom attribute: `toc!`
* Query parameter: `?toc!`
====


[[uc-simplify-toc]]
== Simplify the TOC

Reduce the TOC heading levels for a simplified view of the document.

****
Some documents have so many headings and sections that there is too much detail, even in the TOC.
While that may be OK for the final purpose, for your purpose you want to change your view of it.
****

*Problem: The number of section levels and headings are many*

A simple view of the TOC is needed to understand the document.

*Solution: Use the viewer to reduce the TOC heading levels*

Attribute `toclevels` controls the section levels that are included in the TOC, from 1 to 7.
Add the `toclevels` setting depending on your need below:

* For all documents viewed, use a xref:custom-attributes-option.adoc[common attribute]:

 toclevels=1

* For the current document, use a xref:features.adoc#url-query-parameters[query parameters]:

 ?toclevels=1

* If editing the document, use this AsciiDoc in the header:

 :toclevels: 1

TIP: To see more detail in the TOC, increase the `toclevels` value.

== Add a simplified TOC

To combine the use cases of <<uc-add-toc>> and <<uc-simplify-toc>> you can set both `toc` and `toclevels` at the same time:

* For all documents viewed, set these as xref:custom-attributes-option.adoc[common attributes]:

 toc=left toclevels=1

* For the current document, use these xref:features.adoc#url-query-parameters[query parameters]:

 ?toc=left&toclevels=1

* If editing the document, use this AsciiDoc in the header:

 :toc: left
 :toclevels: 1


== Minimal effort writing

Create and write an AsciiDoc quickly using the {project-name} to apply your most commonly used settings.

****
When taking notes, you just want to write and not add for example settings for the TOC, nice admonition icons and other items.
****

*Objective: Just write, leaving other settings until later if at all*

Use the features of {project-name} to save time.

*Solution: Put commonly used attributes into the xref:custom-attributes-option.adoc[]*

For all documents viewed, set this xref:custom-attributes-option.adoc[custom attributes option string]:

 toc=left icons=font experimental source-highlighter=highlight.js

The above Custom attributes options string set the equivalent AsciiDoc attributes below:

.AsciiDoc header
[,asciidoc]
----
= <title>
:toc: left <.>
:icons: font <.>
:experimental: <.>
:source-highlighter: highlight.js <.>
----
<.> A left hand TOC
<.> Use Font Awesome for icons and admonition icons
<.> Enable GUI macros +
`\btn:[button]` for btn:[button] +
`\kbd:[control-A]` for kbd:[control-A] and +
`\menu:Menu[Item,...]` for select menu:Menu[Item,...]
<.> Syntax highlighting with `highlight.js`

Congratulations, you can now have a collection of AsciiDoc notes with minimal effort, and view them with the {project-name}.
