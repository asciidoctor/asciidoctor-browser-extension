:navtitle: Load the JavaScript

Choose when JavaScript is loaded into the HTML5 page, either before or after the document has been rendered.

There is a single choice between the following:

* After the document is loaded (Default)
* Before the document is loaded

The purpose of the JavaScript and the type or size of the AsciiDoc document being rendered may affect your decision.
