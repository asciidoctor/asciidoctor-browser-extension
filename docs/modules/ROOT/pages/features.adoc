:source-language: asciidoc

The main feature is viewing AsciiDoc as HTML5 directly in the browser.
Other features cover where those AsciiDoc files are located, and how they are rendered.

You can exercise these features by using the xref:quickstart.adoc[] page.

[#example]
== View AsciiDoc as HTML5

The screen capture below shows raw AsciiDoc on the left, and rendered HTML5 on the right.

If the extension is inactive, you'll see the raw AsciiDoc.
If it is active, you'll see the rendered HTML5.

Reproduce this example yourself by following the instructions in the xref:quickstart.adoc[] page.

image::{url-asciidoctor-sc-image}["Screen capture of two screens, showing raw AsciiDoc and rendered as HTML5"]

== Auto reload

If the content of the page is changed, the rendered view is automatically refreshed.

This means that if you edit the viewed AsciiDoc and save, the rendered view will change.

See xref:options.adoc#poll-for-changes[Poll for Changes] on the options page.

[[set-asciidoc-attributes]]
== Use AsciiDoc attributes

You can set AsciiDoc attributes in the {project-name} to control how your AsciiDoc document is rendered to HTML, without affecting the original document.

The final view is determined by attributes and settings in the:

* Document, including any attributes included from other documents
* Extension option xref:custom-attributes-option.adoc[Custom attributes string]
* <<url-query-parameters>> to the {project-name}

The attribute settings are applied in the above order of precedence, with query parameters being applied last.

[#url-query-parameters]
== URL query parameters

You may use URL query parameters to change how the extension previews AsciiDoc. You can set:

* attribute values with `?<attribute-name>=<value>`
* stylesheet used with `?stylesheet=<stylesheet name>` 

*Where to put the query parameters*

Query parameters are indicated by the first `?` character in the URL and are terminated by the character `#` or the end of the URL.

TIP: If setting attributes or the stylesheet via the URL is not working, check that the query parameters are before any `#` character in the URL.

*Add the first query parameter (`?`)*

For example, to reduce the depth of section levels that are displayed in the table of contents to one, add `?toclevels=1` to the URL (after the document name, and before any `#` character):

.URL query parameters
[,url,subs=+quotes]
----
https://example.com/page.adoc**?toclevels=1**
----

*Add a second or more parameters (`&`)*

To add one more parameter, add an ampersand (`&`) to the end of the last query parameter, followed by the next attribute setting.

It will look like this:

URL query parameters
[,url,subs=+quotes]
----
https://example.com/page.adoc**?toclevels=1&stylesheet=maker**
----

*Example*

You have a document `ex-query.adoc` that uses two attributes `\{first}` and `\{last}` to say "Hello \{first} \{last}!" in the document title.

.ex-query.adoc
[subs="-attributes",indent=0]
----
= Hello {first} {last}!

Query parameters example
----

TIP: Download the above document from xref:attachment$ex-query.adoc[ex-query.adoc]

Then, to send a first and last name to the document via the URL, you would add `?first=Irma&last=Writer` to the URL directly after the `ex-query.adoc` and before any `#` character.

.URL query parameters
[,url,subs=+quotes]
----
file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/ex-query.adoc**?first=Irma&last=Writer**
----

You should see the following result:

[indent=0]
====
[discrete]
= Hello Irma Writer!

== Change themes and stylesheets

Change the stylesheet, CSS, or both, that are used to render HTML5 from the AsciiDoc.
For example, you may prefer a darker or a more compact presentation style.

The Theme/Stylesheet can be changed for:

* all files previewed via the extension xref:theme-stylesheet-option.adoc[]

* the current file with <<url-query-parameters>>.

== View AsciiDoc files locally and remote

View AsciiDoc files from different locations.

The extension allows you to view AsciiDoc files from your local file system and from the Web:

* Local URLs start with `file://`
* Remote URLs start with `https://` (this includes developer platforms such as GitHub or GitLab)
+
TIP: Use _Raw Mode_ to view AsciiDoc files using the {project-name} and not native rendering provided by developer platforms.

NOTE: Your settings are applied on both local and remote files.

* <<url-query-parameters>>

== Make use of diagrams as text

Using diagrams as text within AsciiDoc allows you to create visual diagrams using plain text, providing a cohesive and unified approach to content creation.

.Three-step process diagram
image::three-step-process.svg[]

With diagrams as text, you can do the same with diagrams. 
There are many types of diagrams that can be generated this way from basic block diagrams to complex technical architecture diagrams including data-science visualizations, entity relationships, and more.

When the xref:diagrams-extension-option.adoc[] is enabled via the xref:options.adoc[], the {project-name} converts diagrams from text to image using a local or remote Kroki diagram server, and shows them as if they were local or remote image files in the HTML.

Learn more on the xref:diagrams-extension-option.adoc[] page.

== Markdown friendly

AsciiDoc accommodates simple markdown in your AsciiDoc document.

This may save you time:

* Writing simple notes
* Converting files from Markdown to AsciiDoc gradually.

Learn more about these two text markup formats at:

* xref:asciidoc::asciidoc-vs-markdown.adoc[Compare AsciiDoc to Markdown] via AsciiDoc (the language)
* xref:asciidoctor:migrate:markdown.adoc[Migrate from Markdown to Asciidoctor] via Asciidoctor (the generator)
