:url-asciidoctor-sc-image: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/screenshot.png
:source-language: asciidoc

The main feature is viewing AsciiDoc as HTML5 directly in the browser.
Other features cover where those AsciiDoc files are located, and how they are rendered.

You can exercise these features in the  <<try-it-yourself>> section of this page.

[#example]
== View AsciiDoc as HTML5

The screen capture below shows raw AsciiDoc on the left, and rendered HTML5 on the right.

If the extension is inactive, you'll see the raw AsciiDoc.
If it is active, you'll see the rendered HTML5.

Reproduce this example yourself by following the instructions further below in <<try-it-yourself>>.

image::{url-asciidoctor-sc-image}["Screen capture of two screens, showing raw AsciiDoc and rendered as HTML5"]

== Auto reload

If the content of the page is changed, the rendered view is automatically refreshed.

This means that if you edit the viewed AsciiDoc and save, the rendered view will change.

See xref:options.adoc#poll-for-changes[Poll for Changes] on the options page.

[[set-asciidoc-attributes]]
== Use AsciiDoc attributes

After the extension applies its own Built-in attributes to document, you can set AsciiDoc attributes that affect the preview in the following order by the:

* extension option xref:custom-attributes-option.adoc[Custom attributes string]
* <<url-query-parameters>>
* document including any attribute settings included from other documents

This makes Extension very adaptable for your every day, fast and effective use of AsciiDoc.

[#url-query-parameters]
== URL query parameters

You may use URL query parameters to change how the extension previews AsciiDoc. You can set:

* attribute values with `?attribute=<value>`
* stylesheet used with `?stylesheet=<stylesheet name>` 

*Where to put the query parameters*

Query parameters are indicated by the first (`?`) in the URL and are terminated by the character (`#`) or the end of the URL.

TIP: If setting attributes or the stylesheet via the URL is not working, check that the Query Parameters are before any (`#`) character in the URL.

*Add the first query parameter (`?`)*

For example: To condense a table of contents to one level its current setting, add `?toclevels=1` to URL, after the document name, and before any (`#`) character.

.URL query parameters
[,url,subs=+quotes]
----
https://example.com/page.adoc**?toclevels=1**
----

*Add a second and more parameters (`&`)*

To add one more parameter, add an ampersand (`&`) to the end of the last query parameter, followed by the next attribute setting.

It will look like this:

URL query parameters
[,url,subs=+quotes]
----
https://example.com/page.adoc**?toclevels=1&stylesheet=maker**
----
*Example*

You have a document `ex-query.adoc` that uses two attributes `\{first}` and `\{last}` to say "Hello \{first} \{last}!" in the document title.

.ex-query.adoc
[subs="-attributes",indent=0]
----
= Hello {first} {last}!

Query parameters example
----

TIP: Download the above document from xref:attachment$ex-query.adoc[ex-query.adoc]

Then, to send a first and last name to the document via the URL, you would add `?first=Irma&last=Writer` to the URL directly after the `ex-query.adoc` and before any (`#`) character.

.URL query parameters
[,url,subs=+quotes]
----
file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/ex-query.adoc**?first=Irma&last=Writer**
----


You should see the following result:

[indent=0]
====
[discrete]
= Hello Irma Writer!

== Change Themes and Stylesheets

Change the stylesheet, CSS, or both, that are used to render HTML5 from the AsciiDoc.
For example, you may prefer a darker or a more compact presentation style.

The Theme/Stylesheet can be changed for:

* all files previewed via the extension xref:theme-stylesheet-option.adoc[]

* the current file with <<url-query-parameters>>.

== View AsciiDocs locally and remote

View AsciiDoc files from different locations.

The extension allows you to view AsciiDoc files from your local file system and from the web:

* Local URLs start with `file://`
* Remote URLs start with `https://`
+
This includes hosted Git platforms
+
TIP: *Raw Mode*: To view AsciiDoc files using the {project-name} and not the native AsciiDoc rendering if offered, use the provider's *raw* viewing mode for the file.

Local or remote, your settings in the following are applied:

* xref:options.adoc[]
* <<url-query-parameters>>

== Exploit diagrams as text

AsciiDoc already allows you to write expressive books, articles, text and documentation and if documenting code to keep it next to your code.

.Three step process diagram
image::three-step-process.svg[]

With diagrams as text, you can do the same with diagrams. 
There are many types of diagrams that can be generated this way from the very simple, to the data-science style of diagrams.

When the xref:diagrams-extension-option.adoc[] is specifically enabled via the xref:options.adoc[], the {project-name} converts diagrams from text to image using a local or remote Kroki diagram server, and shows them as if they were local or remote image files in the HTML.

Learn more on the xref:diagrams-extension-option.adoc[] page.

== Markdown friendly

AsciiDoc accommodates simple markdown in your AsciiDoc document.

This may save you time:

* Writing simple notes
* Converting files from markdown to AsciiDoc gradually.

Learn more about these two text markup formats at:

* xref:asciidoc::asciidoc-vs-markdown.adoc[Compare AsciiDoc to Markdown] via AsciiDoc (the language)
* xref:asciidoctor:migrate:markdown.adoc[Migrate from Markdown to Asciidoctor] via Asciidoctor (the generator)

[#try-it-yourself]
== Try it yourself

To reproduce the example shown in <<example>>, do the following:

:exfile: ex-writing-zen.adoc

. Install the {project-name} using the xref:install.adoc[] page
. Create `{exfile}` from the text below or xref:attachment${exfile}[download] it.
+
.ex-writing-zen.adoc
-----
include::attachment${exfile}[]
-----

. Open `{exfile}` in your browser. You may either:

* Open it by pressing kbd:[Control,O]
* Drag and drop `{exfile}` onto your browser
* Double-click `{exfile}`
+
NOTE: For double-click to work, you may need to change your computer settings to associate `.adoc` with your web browser.

. Try different features with the following:

.. Toggle the {project-name} activation by clicking its extension icon in the browser bar.
+
You'll see the AsciiDoc behind the rendered HTML page.
.. Change the xref:theme-stylesheet-option.adoc[] and reload.
.. Change the Theme/Stylesheet using a query parameter.
Add `stylesheet=github` to the end of the URL.
.. Edit the AsciiDoc file and save.
Observe it update.
.. Add `toc=left` to xref:custom-attributes-option.adoc[], and reload.

. Next steps
+
After the above, you may like to try the exercise in the xref:diagrams-extension-option.adoc[].

== Use cases

Use cases for using Custom attributes.

* For example, to position the Table Of Content (TOC) to the left of the main content column, you can set `toc=left` in the *Custom attributes string*.
+
[,txt]
----
toc=left
----

* Then for example, you may want to see the TOC with more levels, and so add `toclevels=4` to the *Custom attributes string*.
+
[,txt]
----
toc=left toclevels=4
----


=== Minimal effort writing

Set the most common AsciiDoc attributes used when writing AsciiDoc documents:

.Custom attributes
[,txt,opts="pre-wrap"]
----
toc=left toclevels=7 icons=font experimental source-highlighter=highlight.js
----

.Equivalent AsciiDoc
[,asciidoc]
----
:toc: left <.>
:toclevels: 7 <.>
:icons: font <.>
:experimental: <.>
:source-highlighter: highlight.js <.>
----
<.> A left hand TOC
<.> TOC shows the maximum of 7 levels if present
<.> Use Font Awesome for icons and admonition icons
<.> Enable GUI macros +
`\btn:[button]` for btn:[button] +
`\kbd:[control-A]` for kbd:[control-A] and +
`\menu:Menu[Item,...]` for select menu:Menu[Item,...]
<.> Syntax highlighting with `highlight.js`

=== Review AsciiDocs without a TOC

Use a TOC to help make reviewing longer AsciiDoc documents easier that don't have a TOC without changing the file.

.Custom attributes
[,txt,opts="pre-wrap"]
----
toc=left toclevels=7
----
