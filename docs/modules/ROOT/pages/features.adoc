The main feature is viewing AsciiDoc as HTML5 directly in the browser.
Other features cover where those AsciiDoc files are located, and how they are rendered.

You can exercise these features in the  <<try-it-yourself>> section of this page.

[#example]
== View AsciiDoc as HTML5

The screen capture below shows raw AsciiDoc on the left, and rendered HTML5 on the right.

If the extension is inactive, you'll see the raw AsciiDoc.
If it is active, you'll see the rendered HTML5.

Reproduce this example yourself by following the instructions further below in <<try-it-yourself>>.

image::{url-asciidoctor-sc-image}["Screen capture of two screens, showing raw AsciiDoc and rendered as HTML5"]

== Auto reload

If the content of the page is changed, the rendered view is automatically refreshed.

This means that if you edit the viewed AsciiDoc and save, the rendered view will change.

See xref:options.adoc#poll-for-changes[Poll for Changes] on the options page.

== Insert AsciiDoc attributes

Insert a set of attributes to each page viewed.

This can make your every day use of AsciiDoc for notes, fast and effective.

See xref:custom-attributes.adoc[].

== Change the presentation style

AsciiDoc separates content from presentation.

Change the stylesheet or CSS that is used to render HTML5 from the AsciiDoc.
For example, you may prefer a darker or a more compact presentation style.
See xref:options.adoc[].

== View AsciiDoc files from different locations

The extension allows you to view AsciiDoc files and optionally (`.txt`) files that are:

* Local to your browser (`file://`)
* Remote (`https://`)
+
This includes hosted Git platforms
+
TIP: *Raw Mode*: To view AsciiDoc files using the {project-name} and not the native AsciiDoc rendering if offered, use the provider's *raw* viewing mode for the file.

== Exploit diagrams as text

AsciiDoc already allows you to write expressive books, articles, text and documentation and if documenting code to keep it next to your code.

With diagrams as text, you can do the same with diagrams. 
There are many types of diagrams that can be generated this way from the very simple, to the data-science style of diagrams.

When the xref:diagrams-extension.adoc[] is specifically enabled via the xref:options.adoc[], the {project-name} converts diagrams from text to image using a local or remote Kroki diagrams server, and shows them as if they were local or remote image files in the HTML.

Learn more on the xref:diagrams-extension.adoc[] page.

== Tolerates simple markdown

AsciiDoc tolerates simple markdown markup.

This may save you time:

* Writing simple notes
* Converting files from markdown to AsciiDoc gradually.

* Asciidoc - xref:asciidoc::asciidoc-vs-markdown[Compare AsciiDoc to Markdown]
* Asciidoctor - xref:asciidoctor:migrate:markdown[Migrate from Markdown to Asciidoctor]

[#try-it-yourself]
== Try it yourself

To reproduce the example shown in <<example>>, do the following:

. Install the {project-name} using the xref:install.adoc[] page
. Copy and paste the AsciiDoc text below to a file called `try-features.adoc`
+
.try-features.adoc

You'll see the AsciiDoc behind the rendered HTML page.

.. Edit the AsciiDoc file and save.
.. Add `toc=left` to xref:custom-attributes.adoc[].
